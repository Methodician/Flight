  <h2>WE DO AWESOME RIGHT</h2>
  <h4 class="awesome-p">A boutique web development and design agency offering startup and entrepreneurial consulting</h4>
  <h3 class="italic">. . . at your service . . .</h3>
  <p class="what-we-do">At Flight, we're mastering the art of the MVP. We're honing in on the optimal combo of lean startup best practices, agile
    development methodologies, and awesome sauce. We've assembled a tech stack (combination of tools and technologies used
    to create software) which allows for affordable rapid prototyping that can be scaled and transitioned into enterprise-scale
    services without starting from scratch. That means we can leverage all the code and work we did to launch your MVP while
    we're building and scaling your next-big-thing.</p>
  <p class="what-we-do">If you have a great idea, entrepreneurial drive, and access to resources but you're having trouble formulating your first
    moves or getting "off the ground", we can help!</p>
  <p class="what-we-do">If you've had your dream project on the back burner because you're just not sure, consider a free concept validation session.
    I can't ensure your idea
    <i>will</i> work, but I can usually tell if something has no chance.</p>
  <p class="what-we-do">We also provide a full suite of branding, custom graphics and icons, and professional web design. You can order them as
    sides, appetizers, or as a core element of our primary engineering services.</p>

      <h3>Validation</h3>
      <p>
        I bet you've got a great idea. Not every great idea makes business sense though. Even if we determine the economics are off,
        all is not lost. When a great idea isn't business ready, sometimes a pivot will put you on a valid path.

      <h3>Takeoff</h3>
      <p>A great idea can sit in the queue for years. At some point you have to check your fuel and equipment, taxi to the runway,
        and go all-out. That's the scariest time for any self-respecting entrepreneur but we're here by your side every step
        of the way.</p>
